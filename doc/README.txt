Login/Sign up page

Include files:
	* Login.class
	* Register.class
Test files:
	*LoginTest.class
	*RegisterTest.class

Running Instructions:
	1.Open the application QuicaR, the first page asks the user to login.
	2. If the user does not have an account, the user can click sign up button, 
	fill all the information, and click REGISTER button to create an account.
	3. If the user has already registered, then the user can fill username/email,
	(either will work) and password to login.
Notes and assumptions:
	1. If the user fill wrong or invalid information, the app will block user to login
	or register.
	2. The username must be unique. The app will check duplicate username.

Future improvement:
	1. Improve the design of the login/register page
	2. Let the user chooses to remember the password so that the user doesn't
	need to fill all information again.
	3. (If the time available) sign in by using the fingerprint.
